The members of SRI use the power of science to solve the strange phenomena that are moving in the darkness of modern times. A blood-curdling mystery awaits them...\n\n\"Operation of Great Mysteries'', which aired in 1968, is a masterpiece drama in which Tsuburaya Productions, who suddenly became famous with the Ultra series, departed from the monster route and took on the challenge of creating a SF horror series that made full use of tokusatsu.\n\nMany manga artists took on the challenge of adapting it into a manga but among them, Jiro Kuwata's version, which was serialized in Shueisha's Shonen Book, was a work that depicts the scientific tricks hidden behind the horror of the original work. Its sharp and linear touch was highly praised.\n\nThe horror of a man-eating moth that melts humans and turns them into bones, a mysterious beautiful girl who escapes from paintings and shoots people, and what happens when her beloved becomes a vampire. Based on episodes from the TV version written by tokusatsu script geniuses such as Tetsuo Kinjo and Morichi Ichikawa, Jiro Kuwata's well-oiled pen shines through.\n\nSimultaneously recorded is the imaginary bright school comedy \"School Master''.\nPublished for the first time in book form with the cooperation of Kobunsha!!"},"links":{"mu":"sze9q8e"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"d7d1730f-6eb0-4ba6-9437-602cac38664c","name":{"en":"Vampires"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}

One day, he defends a homeless man against some punks, and the man gives him a strange tattoo on his palm in return. The tattoo is a secret weapon produced in the arms race between America and the Serinistan Kingdom.  \n  \nSeigi finds himself in over his head when a powerful girl, using the same secret weapon, violently pursues him in order to retrieve it. His skill at martial arts may not be enough to keep him alive, but will he be able to learn how to trigger the power of his tattoo in time?  \n  \n[See AnimeNewsNetwork for the anime.](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=17122)\n\nWikipedia\n[Arabic](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88_%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%88)\n[Chinese (Traditional)](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/TABOO_TATTOO%EF%BC%8D%E7%A6%81%E5%BF%8C%E5%92%92%E7%B4%8B%EF%BC%8D)\n[English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_Tattoo)\n[French](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88_%D8%AA%D8%AA%D9%88)\n[German](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_Tattoo)\n[Italian](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_Tattoo)\n[Japanese](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%BF%E3%83%96%E3%83%BC%E3%83%BB%E3%82%BF%E3%83%88%E3%82%A5%E3%83%BC)\n[Persian](https://fa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88_%D8%AA%D8%AA%D9%88)\n[Spanish](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_Tattoo)"},"links":{"al":"47486","ap":"taboo-tattoo","kt":"4819","mal":"17486","mu":"53ukrua","raw":"https://yenpress.com/series/taboo-tattoo"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"erotica","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

This time, several of the stories are either brand new or adapted from or to the Lupin anime, and the beginning story was even animated by itself several years later!\n\nLupin the Third is the grandson of the famous literary thief Arsène Lupin, and his partners in crime include the sharpshooter Jigen Daisuke, the stoic samurai Goemon Ishikawa the Thirteenth, and the on-again-off-again lover/enemy Fujiko Mine. Their goal is to outwit enemies bigger than themselves while nabbing the world's rarest and most important items, while also outwitting the dogged Inspector Zenigata, who's made it his life's work to capture and secure Lupin. In the manga however, his relationship with the titular thief isn't as \"respecting to the enemy\" as you would expect, as he's attempted multiple times to kill him without shedding a tear!\n\nWhat kind of sexy exploits will Lupin and his crew get up to next in…Shin Lupin III!"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"5ca48985-9a9d-4bd8-be29-80dc0303db72","name":{"en":"Crime"}},{"id":"7b2ce280-79ef-4c09-9b58-12b7c23a9b78","name":{"en":"Fan Colored"}},{"id":"81183756-1453-4c81-aa9e-f6e1b63be016","name":{"en":"Samurai"}},{"id":"85daba54-a71c-4554-8a28-9901a8b0afad","name":{"en":"Mafia"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"97893a4c-12af-4dac-b6be-0dffb353568e","name":{"en":"Sexual Violence"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"df33b754-73a3-4c54-80e6-1a74a8058539","name":{"en":"Police"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}}]}
