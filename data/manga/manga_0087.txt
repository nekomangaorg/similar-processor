In addition to the biographical series that spotlights Yoshitsugu Otani, the military commander Ieyasu feared most at the Battle of Sekigahara, this book covers episodes of well-known Sengoku warlords from Saga, Aizu, and Tosa from Taro Minamoto's unique perspective. A new bonus track, \"An Infinitely Long Hour...and a Half?'' (8 pages), which describes the first encounter with Osamu Tezuka, is newly included. Also includes an afterword with a new narration. The cover uses an illustration by Ryo Kudo, who is familiar from the cover of ``Fuunjitachi''."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/風雲戦国伝-風雲児たち外伝-みなもと-太郎-ebook/dp/B00KWYE6I6","bw":"de0c31827a-a755-4367-a11c-53c102e572ec","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/190199/","mu":"1mlr7dx"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"81183756-1453-4c81-aa9e-f6e1b63be016","name":{"en":"Samurai"}}]}

It turns out the pig wasn't injured, just hungry, and he gets back his health when he eats Karin's apple. When Karin gets to school, she discovers that the pig has stowed away in her backpack, which causes her more trouble. Later she meets the pig again and finds out he can talk and fly, and he gives her a \"pigompact,\" which she opens--and a pig snout appears from it and attaches itself to her nose! She finds the pig again, who explains that he is actually Prince Tonrariāno III of the planet Buuringo. He tells her how she can transform: by saying \"BA BI BU BE BOorin!\" and she transforms into a superpowered pink piglet called Buurin. This is not something Karin is happy about at all, as she'd rather transform into a heroine like her idol the henshin hero tokusatsu character \"Cutey Chao\" (who is possibly a reference to Cutey Honey).
