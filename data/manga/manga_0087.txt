The governments of the world responded right away with the Big Breasts Isolation Law. Any women found to have D-cup breasts or larger is to be arrested and sent to the internment camp SICS - Six Chambers For The Sick.\n\nYuki Kishida is an ordinary, albeit androgynous high school boy who is living post-pandemic. One night, while walking home from school, a masked man knocks him unconscious. When he wakes up, he finds himself on a train to SICS, alongside other large-breasted women who have been detained.
