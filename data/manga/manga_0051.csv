The total number of tankobon published (26 volumes) exceeded 30 million, and the magazine in which it appeared, \"Weekly Shonen Champion\" became the first in the Japanese manga world to sell 2 million copies, which is a testament to the popularity of the manga.\n\nFor this e-book version, we have decided to use the Akita Shoten version (first edition) and \"Gaki Deka THE BEST\" (3 volumes, Shogakukan Creative) as the base.\n\n\"Gaki Deka THE BEST\" is basically scanned directly from the original manuscripts, proofread by the magazines in which they were published (Weekly Shonen Champion, Monthly Shonen Champion, etc.), and proofread by the mangaka, so the works included in \"Gaki Deka THE BEST\" have been fully utilized. The other works are not included in the book.\n\nOther works are based on the Akita Shoten version of the first edition.\n\nHowever, as was the custom in the publishing world at the time, the Akita Shoten edition was not released in the order in which it was first published, but in the order in which it appeared in the magazine. In addition, there were several manuscripts in the second and later editions of the Akita Shoten edition that had been revised, perhaps to respond to complaints.\n\n\nThis is \"Gaki Deka\" which is said to be one of the achievements of postwar democracy, Shunsuke Tsurumi is said to have said.\n\nAs long as \"Gaki Deka\" is read by everyone, as long as people have the self-image of \"Oh, there are people like this in Japan\" or \"Japan is like this\" I think we are still safe. I feel that we still have one step to go to the point where we can create a posture for war by saying, \"Fight for justice\" or \"crusade\".\n\n(Shunsuke Tsurumi, \"From the History of Manga\") I think that \"Gaki Deka\" is a work that should be read \"now,\" perhaps in this sense as well,\nRegardless of this, please read and laugh at this work first."},"links":{"al":"152669","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B075TSNCK9?binding=kindle_edition\u0026ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tukn","ap":"gaki-deka","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-2353274","mal":"144826","mu":"jz4jpqf"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5ca48985-9a9d-4bd8-be29-80dc0303db72","name":{"en":"Crime"}},{"id":"799c202e-7daa-44eb-9cf7-8a3c0441531e","name":{"en":"Martial Arts"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"da2d50ca-3018-4cc0-ac7a-6b7d472a29ea","name":{"en":"Delinquents"}},{"id":"df33b754-73a3-4c54-80e6-1a74a8058539","name":{"en":"Police"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

Then one day, he meets Kaina, a woman who calls herself the “last summoned person”, who was hand-picked by the goddess to eat those who have reneged on their promises… \n\nThe newest work from the author of Corpse Princess."},"links":{"al":"150308","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B09TL823H2","ap":"cheat-eater-isekai-shoukan-kotogotoku-horobubeshi","bw":"series/345743/list","mu":"199497","raw":"https://storia.takeshobo.co.jp/manga/cheateater/"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"ace04997-f6bd-436e-b261-779182193d3d","name":{"en":"Isekai"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}}]}

As a girl from the 21st century, she struggles to keep up the appearance of the angelic “Maise” while defying the fate laid out for her by a harem romance novel. That’s right, Maise’s boyfriend is none other than the goofy and lovable protagonist, and every woman in the book has her eyes on him. Right after she dumps him to work toward her own happy ending, Maise gets set up on a blind date with a man named Eith Lancell. She falls head over heels for Eith, but notices his strange behavior at times… Something’s weird about this devilishly handsome new beau.

Another specific girl goes on a journey to fight the Tokoshie, sworn in as her parents' enemies. In short, this is the chronicle of an endless struggle between humanity and its greatest enemy ever.","pt-br":"Nesta história, armas gigantes não identificadas destruíram as grandes cidades do mundo em 2030. Os mentores dessa destruição sem precedentes são conhecidos como “Tokoshie”. Eles se autodenominam armas quando saem para as ruas das cidades com seus poderes avassaladores e desaparecem assim que as destroem. Quase uma década se passa desde então. Uma certa companhia militar está desenvolvendo um drone de combate com habilidade para lutar contra os Tokoshie, e uma certa figura milionária parte em uma jornada subterrânea para descobrir o segredo da vida eterna deles. Outra garota específica parte em uma jornada para lutar contra os Tokoshie, declarados inimigos de seus pais. Em suma, esta é a crônica de uma luta sem limites entre a humanidade e seu maior inimigo de todos os tempos.  \n\n\n---\n\n  \n**Socials \u0026 Related**  \n[Official Website](https://tokoshie-bullet.com/)  \n[Tokoshie × Bullet official Twitter](https://twitter.com/tokoshie_morion)  \n[Author's Twitter](https://twitter.com/morion_airline?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) | [Author's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/morion_airline/)  \n[Artist's Twitter](https://twitter.com/DEART_Akeji) | [Artist's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/deart_akeji/)  \n[Kodansha Retail Info](https://kc.kodansha.co.jp/product?item=0000348980)"},"links":{"al":"125008","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B095WC99V1","ap":"tokoshi-x-bullet-shin-minato-koubou-sen","bw":"series/286823/list","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/622104/","mal":"136151","mu":"172949","raw":"https://comic-days.com/episode/13933686331715990246"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}}]}

The face belongs to Petty Officer Third Class Jack Ohara, a fictional character who is newly assigned to the carrier as it sets sail for Japan. The manga, titled after the ship's hull number, does not address nuclear safety directly, instead subtly implying that it is a non-issue by having the crew go about their business without any apparent concern on the topic.

It is a strictly structured society with many rules, such as those governing when and where a predator is allowed to hunt their prey.  \n  \nOne lion, Leon, does not quite fit into the role nature has chosen for him. He doesn't grow his mane out, and, despite his physical strength, he shows no real interest in establishing territory and acquiring a harem of lionesses. But the most abnormal quirk of all is that Leon is a vegetarian lion!  \n  \nHis tiger companion (who has a bit of a crush on him), is firmly of the opinion that herbivores exist to be eaten, but she manages to mostly put up with his vegetarianism. One day, the two of them rescue a frightened gazelle, freshly arrived from the capital. The tiger is less than thrilled to have a pretty female food-animal hanging around with them, but the jackals who are tracking the gazelle seem to have some kind of business with Leon as well…  \n\n\n---\n\n**Links:**  \n- [Author's Twitter](https://twitter.com/glc09bk88pgot7u)"},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A8%E3%82%81%E8%B2%B7%E3%81%84-%E3%83%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E2%98%85%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0/dp/B07HCCKJTT/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1537206617\u0026sr=8-6\u0026keywords=%E3%83%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0","ap":"the-wild-kingdom","bw":"series/175159","kt":"45490","mal":"99784","mu":"10874"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"aafb99c1-7f60-43fa-b75f-fc9502ce29c7","name":{"en":"Harem"}},{"id":"dd1f77c5-dea9-4e2b-97ae-224af09caf99","name":{"en":"Monster Girls"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}}]}
