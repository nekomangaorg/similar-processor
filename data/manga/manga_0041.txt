He gets his kicks from sex, but when things cool down, it's all over. While at work, Jiro reunites with his classmate from college, Toua, who's a model that got his job by lying on his resume. In exchange for Jiro keeping quiet about it, they have sex, and this is the start of their \"special relationship.\" But, it turns out that Toua is a rude guy with no brain-to-mouth filter who sleeps around. Even though Jiro understands that Toua has many flaws that cannot be fixed, they are frustratingly perfect for each other in bed… All Jiro knows about Toua is just where to touch him, but not much else."},"links":{"al":"98041","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B01J7ONWFY","ap":"sex-friends","cdj":"http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-1963785?s_ssid=e4609a5b6d55af4783","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/374333/","engtl":"https://www.ebookrenta.com/renta/sc/frm/item/131900","kt":"38853","mal":"100632","mu":"132249"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"5920b825-4181-4a17-beeb-9918b0ff7a30","name":{"en":"Boys' Love"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}}]}

A revised edition followed in 1787. It was one of the most important novels in the Sturm und Drang period in German literature, and influenced the later Romantic movement. Goethe, aged 24 at the time, finished Werther in five-and-a-half weeks of intensive writing in January–March 1774. The book's publication instantly placed the author among the foremost international literary celebrities, and was among the best known of his works."},"links":{"mu":"159682"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

Це ж просто мрія! І зараз ця мрія стала моєю дійсністю. Я переродилася Аїшою Ескліф, другорядним персонажем улюбленої історії. Тепер я зможу спостерігати за дорослішанням мого улюбленця, Авеля Лувмонта! \nЯ анонімно дарувала дорогі подарунки, відвідували ті ж заходи, що й Авель, але, от халепа, його батько, відомий своєю жорстокістю і любов’ю до сина, помітив мою підозрілу активність. Я вже готувалася до смерті, коли мене покликали до його маєтка, але він… запропонував вийти заміж за нього.\n\n---\n**Original Novel:** [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/53939645), [Naver Series](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=6627511)\n\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%EB%82%A8%EC%A3%BC%EC%9D%98-%EC%97%84%EB%A7%88%EA%B0%80-%EB%90%98%EC%96%B4%EB%B2%84%EB%A0%B8%EB%8B%A4/2445), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/56070306)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/i-married-the-male-leads-dad/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.podoteng.com/)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%88%91%E6%98%AF%E5%90%8D%E5%89%AF%E5%85%B6%E5%AF%A6%E7%9A%84%E5%AA%BD%E5%AA%BD%E7%B2%89/151)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Aku-Jadi-Ibu-Pemeran-Utama-Laki-laki/184)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/66610)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81/100)"},"links":{"al":"127084","ap":"i-became-the-heros-mom","engtl":"https://tapas.io/series/i-married-the-male-leads-dad/info","kt":"58281","mal":"147664","mu":"174495","nu":"i-became-the-heros-mother","raw":"https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=56070306"},"originalLanguage":"ko","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"0bc90acb-ccc1-44ca-a34a-b9f3a73259d0","name":{"en":"Reincarnation"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"a1f53773-c69a-4ce5-8cab-fffcd90b1565","name":{"en":"Magic"}},{"id":"ace04997-f6bd-436e-b261-779182193d3d","name":{"en":"Isekai"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

One is unsurprised to encounter a creature that is half elderly man, half crab or a flying frog in this world where our guide apparent is an anthropomorphic, mollusk-like cat. Sakabashira weaves this absurdist tale in a seamless tapestry constructed of elements as seemingly disparate as Japanese folklore, pop culture, and surrealism.

Hoping to escape from his father's continuous proposals, Tokoha told his father that he likes men – and thus his father should give up on planning an arranged marriage for him. To convince his father, he asked the butler Asou to pretend to be his lover. At first, Tokoha slept with Asou only to deceive his father. But as time passed, he derived great pleasure from their relationship. How will the fake love between the cool butler and the young master continue?  \n  \n3: Kiss For Reward  \nTanigawa has been Arisu-sensei's student since Arisu was in college: first as a home-tutor student, and now as a student in the school where Arisu works. Tanigawa has changed so much, from a child to a man… except for one thing: he always asks for a kiss if he gets 100 on his tests! Arisu feels that he should put an end to this, but how does Tanigawa feel about that?  \n  \n4: Can't Wait To Feast On You  \nKumi has been with Ayato, his bodyguard/butler, since he was a child. Kumi always thought he felt \"big brotherly\" love toward Ayato… until he saw a woman kissing him. Realizing he was in love with Ayato and that he would not be able to have him to himself, Kumi decided to flush discretion down the toilet and sleep with any girl he could get his hands on. That backfires of course and Kumi finds himself under the knife of an angry boyfriend…  \n  \n5: In Heat Limit  \nKuro was abandoned in the rain when he was a kitten. A beautiful white cat, Shiro, saved him and brought him back home where Kuro has lived ever since. Kuro has always been clingy around Shiro, but recently Shiro seems to be avoiding him. Depressed, Kuro thinks Shiro doesn't like him… but maybe its just that Shiro is in heat…  \n  \n6: It Feels Like A Honeymoon  \nMasaya just got a new brother: his classmate, Tomoyuki. Their parents fell in love at first sight, and now they're family. Masaya continues his womanizing ways until their classmates start joking that Tomo and Masaya are like newlyweds… suddenly, Masaya can't take his eyes off his new brother.  \n  \n7: Between The Fangs  \nLittle Chris was dying on the streets when a man named Luke saved him, whom he discovered to be a vampire.
