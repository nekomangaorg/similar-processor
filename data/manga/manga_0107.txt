When I was a child, I learned poems by rote memorization and never really understood what the poets were trying to express. My exam results depended entirely on how well I could recall them that day. It was only after I grew up—reading poets’ biographies and scholars’ papers—that I gradually understood the true meaning of the poems, felt their beauty, and genuinely felt proud of our cultural heritage.\n\nBut as a child, learning poetry was truly painful! So I asked myself: Is there any way to help young readers learn poetry more easily and joyfully, while also understanding its true meaning and experiencing its beauty?\n\nAfter reading a great many books and papers on poetry and thinking about it every day, I finally discovered a solution:\n\n1. Depict the poets as lively, adorable animals (for example, Li Bai as a free-spirited Arctic wolf; Meng Haoran as a countryside-loving white rabbit).\n\n2. Render the poets’ life stories as engaging comics (for instance, Li Bai learned to read at age 5, studied the “Hundred Schools” at age 10, attended school on Mount Kuang at 18, apprenticed at 19, set out travelling at 20, married in at-marriage at 27, arrived in Chang’an at 30, had his audience with the emperor at 42, first met Du Fu in Luoyang at 44, was imprisoned in palace struggles at 57, and was released by the emperor at 59… All events are based on scholarly research, not fabrications or online encyclopedias).\n\n3. Place each poem in the period of Li Bai’s life when it was composed (for example, at 27—when he married into the family—he wrote “Raising my head, I gaze at the bright moon; lowering it, I think of home.” At 31—when his job hunt in Chang’an failed—he wrote, “Sometime I’ll ride the wind and cleave the waves, setting my cloud-like sail to cross the boundless sea.” At 59—when he was freed—he wrote, “The gibbons’ cries on both banks never cease; a light boat has already passed ten thousand mountains.”).\n\nThus was born our “Animal Poetry Town” series. The first three volumes feature, respectively, the “Immortal of Poetry” Li Bai, the “Saint of Poetry” Du Fu, and the “Buddha of Poetry” Wang Wei.\n\nSource: [https://zh.wikifur.com/wiki/诗词动物城：漫画李白传](https://zh.wikifur.com/wiki/诗词动物城：漫画李白传)"},"originalLanguage":"zh","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

A Grand Prince who, like himself, would never become the Crown Prince, nor the King. Yet, aside from that, Lee Nanyoung was a completely different being.\n\nHe began teaching Nanyoung at the King’s, his elder brother’s, request, but the boy had no talent for swordsmanship, possessed a frustratingly gentle nature, and trusted people with an almost pathetic naiveté.\n\nDespite being a Grand Prince, no one held any expectations for Nanyoung. Not even for him to survive to adulthood.\n\n“I want to be a man like you, Uncle.”\n\nFrom the moment they met, Nanyoung admired Taerok and saw him as the epitome of the man he wished to become. His uncle, Taerok, was unique and irreplaceable to him.\n\nHowever, as his feelings for Taerok deepened beyond admiration, he became consumed by confusion. And Taerok ends up witnessing a kiss with another man, a kiss meant to confirm his own feelings—.\n\n“You will become a source of scandal for me, young prince.
